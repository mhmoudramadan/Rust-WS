/**
 *     Compound types can group multiple values into one type
 *      two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.
 *      Arrays like [1, 2, 3]
 *      Tuples like (1, true)
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *   ******************** tuple **********
 * 
 *  1-is a collection of values of different types.
 *  Tuples are constructed using parentheses (), and each tuple itself is a value with type signature (T1, T2, ...),
 *  where T1, T2 are the types of its members.
 * 
 * 2- Functions can use tuples to return multiple values, as tuples can hold any number of values.
//  
// tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type. 
// Tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.
// We create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values inside parentheses. 
//Each position in the tuple has a type, and the types of the different values in the tuple donâ€™t have to be the same
*/
/**
 * 
 *          The Array Type
 *  Another way to have a collection of multiple values is with an array. 
 *  Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type. 
 *  Unlike arrays in some other languages, arrays in Rust have a fixed length.
 *  
 *  We write the values in an array as a comma-separated list inside square brackets:
